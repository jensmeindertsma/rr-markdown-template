We're using TailwindCSS, so none of the rendered elements will have any decoration at all. No list bullets, no italic, no code in monospaced font

### Heading Level 3

#### Heading Level 4

See that horizontal break we just did?

This is a paragraph.  
Another paragraph with no blank line in between.

Now we'll do a paragraph with a separated line.

This is part 2 then..

- _italic_
- **bold**
- ~~strikethrough~~
- **_bold italic_**

Now we'll do some lists

- Item 2
  - Nested item A
  - Nested item B
- Item 3

## Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Sub-item a
   2. Sub-item b
3. Third item

## Blockquote

> This is a blockquote.
> It spans multiple lines.

  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
